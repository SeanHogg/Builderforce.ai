# Repository Guidelines

- Repo: https://github.com/seanhogg/builderforce
- GitHub issues/comments/PR comments: use literal multiline strings or `-F - <<'EOF'` (or $'...') for real newlines; never embed "\\n".

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- Source code: `src/` (CLI wiring in `src/cli`, commands in `src/commands`, web provider in `src/provider-web.ts`, infra in `src/infra`, media pipeline in `src/media`).
- Tests: colocated `*.test.ts`.
- Docs: `docs/` (images, queue, Pi config). Built output lives in `dist/`.
- Plugins/extensions: live under `extensions/*` (workspace packages). Keep plugin-only deps in the extension `package.json`; do not add them to the root `package.json` unless core uses them.
- Plugins: install runs `npm install --omit=dev` in plugin dir; runtime deps must live in `dependencies`. Avoid `workspace:*` in `dependencies` (npm install breaks); put `builderforce` in `devDependencies` or `peerDependencies` instead (runtime resolves `builderforce/plugin-sdk` via jiti alias).
- Installers served from `https://builderforce.ai/*`: live in the sibling repo `../builderforce.ai` (`public/install.sh`, `public/install-cli.sh`, `public/install.ps1`).
- Messaging channels: always consider **all** built-in + extension channels when refactoring shared logic (routing, allowlists, pairing, command gating, onboarding, docs).
  - Core channel docs: `docs/channels/`
  - Core channel code: `src/telegram`, `src/discord`, `src/slack`, `src/signal`, `src/imessage`, `src/web` (WhatsApp web), `src/channels`, `src/routing`
  - Extensions (channel plugins): `extensions/*` (e.g. `extensions/msteams`, `extensions/matrix`, `extensions/zalo`, `extensions/zalouser`, `extensions/voice-call`)
- When adding channels/extensions/apps/docs, update `.github/labeler.yml` and create matching GitHub labels (use existing channel/extension label colors).

## Docs Linking (Mintlify)

- Docs are hosted on Mintlify (docs.builderforce.ai).
- Internal doc links in `docs/**/*.md`: root-relative, no `.md`/`.mdx` (example: `[Config](/configuration)`).
- When working with documentation, read the mintlify skill.
- Section cross-references: use anchors on root-relative paths (example: `[Hooks](/configuration#hooks)`).
- Doc headings and anchors: avoid em dashes and apostrophes in headings because they break Mintlify anchor links.
- When Peter asks for links, reply with full `https://docs.builderforce.ai/...` URLs (not root-relative).
- When you touch docs, end the reply with the `https://docs.builderforce.ai/...` URLs you referenced.
- README (GitHub): keep absolute docs URLs (`https://docs.builderforce.ai/...`) so links work on GitHub.
- Docs content must be generic: no personal device names/hostnames/paths; use placeholders like `user@gateway-host` and “gateway host”.

## Docs i18n (zh-CN)

- `docs/zh-CN/**` is generated; do not edit unless explicitly asked. Pipeline: `scripts/docs-i18n`. See `docs/.i18n/README.md`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- Runtime baseline: Node **22+** (keep Node + Bun paths working).
- Install deps: `pnpm install`
- If deps are missing (for example `node_modules` missing, `vitest not found`, or `command not found`), run the repo’s package-manager install command (prefer lockfile/README-defined PM), then rerun the exact requested command once. Apply this to test/build/lint/typecheck/dev commands; if retry still fails, report the command and first actionable error.
- Pre-commit hooks: `prek install` (runs same checks as CI)
- Also supported: `bun install` (keep `pnpm-lock.yaml` + Bun patching in sync when touching deps/patches).
- Prefer Bun for TypeScript execution (scripts, dev, tests): `bun <file.ts>` / `bunx <tool>`.
- Run CLI in dev: `pnpm builderforce ...` (bun) or `pnpm dev`.
- Node remains supported for running built output (`dist/*`) and production installs.
- Mac packaging (dev): `scripts/package-mac-app.sh` defaults to current arch. Release checklist: `docs/platforms/mac/release.md`.
- Type-check/build: `pnpm build`
- TypeScript checks: `pnpm tsgo`
- Lint/format: `pnpm check`
- Format check: `pnpm format` (oxfmt --check)
- Format fix: `pnpm format:fix` (oxfmt --write)
- Tests: `pnpm test` (vitest); coverage: `pnpm test:coverage`

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Language: TypeScript (ESM). Prefer strict typing; avoid `any`.
- Formatting/linting via Oxlint and Oxfmt; run `pnpm check` before commits.
- Never add `@ts-nocheck` and do not disable `no-explicit-any`; fix root causes and update Oxlint/Oxfmt config only when required.
- Never share class behavior via prototype mutation (`applyPrototypeMixins`, `Object.defineProperty` on `.prototype`, or exporting `Class.prototype` for merges). Use explicit inheritance/composition (`A extends B extends C`) or helper composition so TypeScript can typecheck.
- If this pattern is needed, stop and get explicit approval before shipping; default behavior is to split/refactor into an explicit class hierarchy and keep members strongly typed.
- In tests, prefer per-instance stubs over prototype mutation (`SomeClass.prototype.method = ...`) unless a test explicitly documents why prototype-level patching is required.
- Add brief code comments for tricky or non-obvious logic.
- Keep files concise; extract helpers instead of “V2” copies. Use existing patterns for CLI options and dependency injection via `createDefaultDeps`.
- Aim to keep files under ~700 LOC; guideline only (not a hard guardrail). Split/refactor when it improves clarity or testability.
- Naming: use **BuilderForce Agents** for product/app/docs headings; use `builderforce` for CLI command, package/binary, paths, and config keys.

## Release Channels (Naming)

- stable: tagged releases only (e.g. `vYYYY.M.D`), npm dist-tag `latest`.
- beta: prerelease tags `vYYYY.M.D-beta.N`, npm dist-tag `beta` (may ship without macOS app).
- dev: moving head on `main` (no tag; git checkout main).

## Testing Guidelines

- Framework: Vitest with V8 coverage thresholds (70% lines/branches/functions/statements).
- Naming: match source names with `*.test.ts`; e2e in `*.e2e.test.ts`.
- Run `pnpm test` (or `pnpm test:coverage`) before pushing when you touch logic.
- Do not set test workers above 16; tried already.
- Live tests (real keys): `BUILDERFORCE_AGENTS_LIVE_TEST=1 pnpm test:live` (BuilderForce Agents-only) or `LIVE=1 pnpm test:live` (includes provider live tests). Docker: `pnpm test:docker:live-models`, `pnpm test:docker:live-gateway`. Onboarding Docker E2E: `pnpm test:docker:onboard`.
- Full kit + what’s covered: `docs/testing.md`.
- Changelog: user-facing changes only; no internal/meta notes (version alignment, appcast reminders, release process).
- Pure test additions/fixes generally do **not** need a changelog entry unless they alter user-facing behavior or the user asks for one.
- Mobile: before using a simulator, check for connected real devices (iOS + Android) and prefer them when available.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

**Full maintainer PR workflow (optional):** If you want the repo's end-to-end maintainer workflow (triage order, quality bar, rebase rules, commit/changelog conventions, co-contributor policy, and the `review-pr` > `prepare-pr` > `merge-pr` pipeline), see `.agents/skills/PR_WORKFLOW.md`. Maintainers may use other workflows; when a maintainer specifies a workflow, follow that. If no workflow is specified, default to PR_WORKFLOW.

- Create commits with `scripts/committer "<msg>" <file...>`; avoid manual `git add`/`git commit` so staging stays scoped.
- Follow concise, action-oriented commit messages (e.g., `CLI: add verbose flag to send`).
- Group related changes; avoid bundling unrelated refactors.
- PR submission template (canonical): `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- Issue submission templates (canonical): `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`

## Shorthand Commands

- `sync`: if working tree is dirty, commit all changes (pick a sensible Conventional Commit message), then `git pull --rebase`; if rebase conflicts and cannot resolve, stop; otherwise `git push`.

## Git Notes

- If `git branch -d/-D <branch>` is policy-blocked, delete the local ref directly: `git update-ref -d refs/heads/<branch>`.
- Bulk PR close/reopen safety: if a close action would affect more than 5 PRs, first ask for explicit user confirmation with the exact PR count and target scope/query.

## Security & Configuration Tips

- Web provider stores creds at `~/.builderforce/credentials/`; rerun `builderforce login` if logged out.
- Pi sessions live under `~/.builderforce/sessions/` by default; the base directory is not configurable.
- Environment variables: see `~/.profile`.
- Never commit or publish real phone numbers, videos, or live configuration values. Use obviously fake placeholders in docs, tests, and examples.
- Release flow: always read `docs/reference/RELEASING.md` and `docs/platforms/mac/release.md` before any release work; do not ask routine questions once those docs answer them.

## Troubleshooting

- Rebrand/migration issues or legacy config/service warnings: run `builderforce doctor` (see `docs/gateway/doctor.md`).

## Agent-Specific Notes

- Vocabulary: "makeup" = "mac app".
- Never edit `node_modules`. Skill notes go in `tools.md` or `AGENTS.md`.
- When adding a new `AGENTS.md`, add a sibling `CLAUDE.md` reference file.
- When working on a GitHub Issue or PR, print the full URL at the end of the task.
- Verify answers in code; do not guess.
- Never update the Carbon dependency.
- Any dependency with `pnpm.patchedDependencies` must use an exact version (no `^`/`~`). Patching deps requires explicit approval.
- CLI progress: use `src/cli/progress.ts`; status tables: `src/terminal/table.ts`.
- Gateway runs as menubar app; restart via BuilderForce Agents Mac app or `scripts/restart-mac.sh`.
- macOS logs: `./scripts/agentlog.sh`. Do not rebuild the macOS app over SSH.
- SwiftUI: prefer `@Observable`/`@Bindable` over `ObservableObject`/`@StateObject`.
- Connection providers: update every UI surface + docs when adding a new connection.
- Version locations: `package.json`, `apps/android/app/build.gradle.kts`, `apps/ios/Sources/Info.plist`, `apps/macos/Sources/BuilderForce Agents/Resources/Info.plist`, `docs/install/updating.md`, `docs/platforms/mac/release.md`. "Bump everywhere" excludes `appcast.xml`.
- **Multi-agent safety:** no `git stash`/`worktree`/branch switches unless explicitly requested. Scope commits to your changes. Keep unrelated WIP untouched. Focus reports on your edits.
- Lint/format churn: auto-resolve formatting-only diffs; only ask on semantic changes.
- CLI palette: `src/terminal/palette.ts` (no hardcoded colors).
- Bug investigations: read source of relevant deps + local code; aim for high-confidence root cause.
- Code style: brief comments on tricky logic; keep files under ~500 LOC.
- Tool schema guardrails: no `Type.Union` in inputs; no `anyOf`/`oneOf`/`allOf`; avoid raw `format` property names.
- Session files: `~/.builderforce/agents/<agentId>/sessions/*.jsonl` (newest unless specified).
- Never send streaming/partial replies to external messaging surfaces; only final replies.
- A2UI bundle hash: auto-generated; only regenerate via `pnpm canvas:a2ui:bundle`.
- Release guardrails: do not change version numbers without operator consent. See `docs/reference/RELEASING.md`.
