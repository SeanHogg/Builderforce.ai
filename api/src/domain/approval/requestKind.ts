/**
 * Human-in-the-loop request kinds.
 *
 * The `approvals` table is the agent's single "bubble up to a human" channel.
 * Every row is one of three kinds, differing only in how a human resolves it:
 *
 *   - `approval` — a high-risk action that must be approved or rejected before
 *     the agent proceeds (the original use case).
 *   - `question` — the agent is blocked and needs a free-text answer to continue.
 *   - `feedback` — the agent wants a human to review work and comment.
 *
 * `question`/`feedback` resolve to status `answered` with the human's text in
 * `response_text`; `approval` resolves to `approved`/`rejected`.
 *
 * Kept in the domain layer (not a route) so the API, the gate contract, and any
 * future caller share one source of truth for the valid set + the default.
