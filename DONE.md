## ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-05 — Live video/audio collaboration: meetings, cameras, calendars (api `2026.7.36` · frontend `2026.7.29`)

Teams can now see and hear each other, not just co-edit a board. Managers can turn cameras on for the whole round-table; anyone can start an ad-hoc or direct call, schedule a meeting, and connect their calendar — for standups, planning, retros or ad-hoc.

- **Meetings backend** (mig 0292: `meetings` · `meeting_attendees` · `calendar_connections`). `POST /api/meetings` schedules or starts a meeting (standup/planning/retrospective/adhoc/direct); join/leave stamp presence + flip a scheduled meeting live; RSVP; organizer/manager-gated start/end/cancel/patch ([meetingRoutes.ts](./api/src/presentation/routes/meetingRoutes.ts)). Create + join are open to any member (anyone can start a call).
- **WebRTC media, mesh P2P.** Camera/mic exchange rides the EXISTING `CeremonyRoomDO` fan-out relay, keyed `media:<roomKey>` — SDP offers/answers + ICE candidates flow client→client with zero DO changes; media never touches the server. `GET /api/meetings/ice` serves STUN (+ TURN when configured). Glare-free negotiation (greater peer-id offers). Frontend hook [useMediaRoom.ts](./frontend/src/lib/useMediaRoom.ts) manages `getUserMedia`, per-peer `RTCPeerConnection`, and camera/mic toggle.
- **Cameras in the round-table.** [CeremonyStage](./frontend/src/components/ceremony/CeremonyStage.tsx) gained a "Join with camera" toggle → a live gallery ([VideoGrid](./frontend/src/components/video/VideoGrid.tsx)/[VideoTile](./frontend/src/components/video/VideoTile.tsx)) + [MediaControls](./frontend/src/components/video/MediaControls.tsx) over the standup/planning ceremony (one media room per project).
- **Meetings surface** at `/meetings` (new nav destination): schedule modal, start-now, live/upcoming list, join → full-screen [MeetingRoom](./frontend/src/components/meetings/MeetingRoom.tsx), and a `?join=<id>` deep link from calendar invites.
- **Calendar connections** (Google Calendar + Microsoft Graph). Per-user OAuth ([calendarRoutes.ts](./api/src/presentation/routes/calendarRoutes.ts) + provider adapters/[calendarService.ts](./api/src/application/calendar/calendarService.ts)); scheduled meetings are mirrored as calendar events (invites to attendee emails), upcoming events surface on `/meetings`. OAuth state/token crypto extracted to shared [oauthState.ts](./api/src/infrastructure/auth/oauthState.ts) (DRY — `oauthRoutes` now delegates to it). New env: `TURN_URL`/`TURN_USERNAME`/`TURN_CREDENTIAL` (optional).
- Fully localized (`meetings.*` + `nav.group.meetings`, all 5 catalogs, 54 keys each) + light/dark + responsive. Verified: api + frontend `tsc --noEmit` 0 errors; all 5 catalogs parse at key parity.

## ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-05 — AI Manager runs are first-class tasks: surfaced, metric-clean, eviction-safe

Closed both residuals logged when the AI Manager "run = a board task" feature shipped, and surfaced the manager's own tasks.

- **Manager tasks surfaced.** The manager overview (`GET /api/manager/:projectId`) now returns `runTasks` — every `source='manager'` "Backlog management pass" the manager kicked off (open / in-progress / done), newest first — rendered as a new **Manager tasks** section on the Manager surface ([ManagerContent.tsx](./frontend/src/components/manager/ManagerContent.tsx)): key, status badge (theme-toned), result summary, owner, updated-time. Fully localized (`manager.runTasks.*` in all 5 catalogs) + light/dark + responsive.
- **Excluded from ALL delivery metrics (no residual).** New shared predicate `notSystemTask` ([application/task/taskScope.ts](./api/src/application/task/taskScope.ts)) — the ONE canonical filter — applied to every task-completion aggregation so system/coordination cards never count: delivery throughput, SPACE, lifecycle + bottleneck (incl. their no-transition fallback), CAPEX/OPEX allocation, workforce/DORA lead-time, engagement, assignee-recommender WIP, project counts (`projectRoutes`), Project 360, ROI, completed-work report, planning spine + `loadTaskCostClassMap`, portfolio rollup, PMO cost-class classify, and the VS Code "my tasks" list. Velocity is clean by construction (points-based; run tasks have no `sprintId`), as are objective/initiative rollups (run tasks have no lineage). The manager's own inline copies were refactored onto the shared predicate too (DRY).
- **Eviction-safe pass.** The grooming pass's per-ticket writes (business-value backfill + `manager_rank` + `score_value` audit rows — 200+ sequential neon-http round-trips on a large backlog, the real Worker-eviction risk) are now collected and flushed via `db.batch` in chunks of 50 (`flushBatched` in [ManagerService.ts](./api/src/application/manager/ManagerService.ts)), collapsing ~700 round-trips into ~14. Scoring/ranking now reliably complete for a 300-ticket backlog in one background pass (the free heuristic fallback already scores every ticket in one pass — the earlier "can't catch up in one click" premise was wrong). The assign/dispatch/audit per-run caps remain BY DESIGN (cost/storm guards), not residuals.
- Verified: api + frontend native typecheck 0 errors (lone pre-existing `builtinMcpService.test.ts` nit, untouched), schema-drift + migration checks pass, all 5 i18n catalogs parse and are in exact key parity.

---

## ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-05 — Unified activity/audit log: gaps & residuals closed (api + frontend `2026.7.27`)

Closed the gaps logged when the canonical `activity_log` + `recordActivity()` stream (mig 0287) shipped.

- **Cloud-agent AI usage now attributed on the heatmap/leaderboard.** `computeInteractionActivity` (`interactionActivity.ts`) now aggregates `llm_usage_log.cloud_agent_ref` (was ignored — only `user_id`/`agent_host_id` mapped) → `cloudAgentDaysByRef` / `cloudAgentTotalsByRef` / `distinctCloudAgentRefs`. `buildActivityCalendar` (`analyticsRoutes.ts`) synthesises an agent roster entry per used `ide_agents` id (negative-id space, name from `ide_agents`) so a purely-cloud agent shows on the leaderboard; `computeTenantActivityRollup` folds cloud refs into the active-contributor count (`ca:` actor key) + top contributors.
- **Remaining mutation sites now emit.** ONE DRY hook in `callBuiltinTool` (`builtinMcpService.ts`) emits for EVERY `mutates:true` MCP/Brain/agent tool run (OKR objectives/key-results, portfolios, initiatives, brain-created tickets, …) with canonical verbs for the common ones (`MCP_VERB` map) — closing the OKR gap and adding broad agent-driven coverage. Added dedicated `pr.merged` (repoRoutes `/pull-requests/:id/merge`) + `member.invited` / `member.added` (tenantRoutes invite), all best-effort.
- **Workforce ▸ Performance surface fully localized.** `ContributorsView.tsx` + `TenantActivityPanel.tsx` (pre-existing hardcoded English, inline-styled) now route every visible string through `useTranslations('contributors')` — new `contributors.*` namespace (stats, leaderboard, heatmap aria/tile, kind badges, legend, tenant-rollup labels, by-type map) in all 5 catalogs. New `audit.verb.{pr,member,okr}.*` labels added too.
- Verified: api typecheck 0 errors, schema-drift + migration checks pass, api suite 1866 pass; frontend typecheck 0 errors, 306/307 tests pass (the 1 failure is a pre-existing/environmental `AgentExecutionPanel` Monaco-diff test, untouched by this work — logged as a fresh test-health gap).

---

## ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-05 — BYO close-out: cloud-compute meter + deterministic non-Anthropic on-prem

Closed the two remaining BYO follow-ups end-to-end.

- **Dedicated "Cloud runs" compute meter.** A cloud run executes on our infra even when the tenant brings their own model (BYO tokens are $0 to us; the orchestration isn't), so cloud usage is now metered independently of token volume. Added `cloudRunsMonthly` to `PlanLimits` (Free 25 / Pro 2 000 / Teams ∞) + `resolveCloudRunsMonthly`; new `application/runtime/cloudRunLedger.ts` (`dailyTenantCloudRuns` / `sumTenantCloudRuns` / `enforceCloudRunCap`) counts distinct `execution_id` on `surface='cloud'` usage rows — no new table, reuses the mig-0284 surface tag. Wired as the 5th meter in the consumption framework (`meters.ts`, `MeterKey`/`MeterUnit` gain `cloud_runs`/`runs`) so it shows in the sidebar `UsageMeter` (☁️ icon, `usageMeter.meter.cloud_runs` in all 5 catalogs, Finance deep-link). Enforced at the ONE cloud choke point — `startDispatchedExecution`'s `!delivered` branch in `runtimeRoutes.ts` — so every cloud entry (Run-now, board, CI-autofix) is gated: over the cap fails the run fast with an upgrade message; on-prem/VSIX runs never touch it; superadmin/unlimited pass; fails open on a metering error. "Shown == enforced" (meter total + gate share `sumTenantCloudRuns`).
- **Deterministic non-Anthropic on-prem BYO.** The `/v1/messages` cascade now HARD-PINS (`modelStrict`) a requested model whose vendor the tenant has connected via BYO, so an on-prem Claude-SDK run on `openai/*` or `googleai/*` rides the tenant's own account instead of silently cascading onto our free pool — mirroring the Anthropic passthrough's "runs on the tenant's account, period" guarantee. A bare/mismatched model stays a soft hint (unchanged).
- Verified: frontend typecheck 0 errors; the new api modules are self-contained and isolated (an unrelated concurrent WIP edit to `taskScope`/`toolRoutes`/`index.ts` was breaking the whole-program api typecheck at close-out — not part of this change). ROADMAP BYO section now has no open follow-ups.

---

## ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-05 — Multi-party chat: invite humans (shared access) + `@agent` actually replies

Closed both remaining residuals of the multi-party-chat gap. Chats are now **global to their project+tenant** (a teammate can see, open and join to collaborate), humans can be **invited by email**, and directing a message to an **`@agent` participant now triggers that agent to answer** as itself.

- **Human-participant + shared-access model (migration `0288`).** New `chat_members` table (active `user_id` **or** pending `invited_email` that auto-converts on first access, mirroring `tenant_invitations`) + `brain_chats.visibility` (`shared` default | `locked`) — the **LOCK primitive**. `BrainService.canAccessChat` replaces the single-owner guard: owner OR (shared → any teammate; auto-recorded as a member on first contribution — the live audience) OR (locked → owner + explicit members). `listChats` surfaces owned + joined + shared; owner-only admin (rename/archive/invite/remove/lock) stays on `user_id`.
- **Invite + delivery.** `POST/GET/DELETE /api/brain/chats/:id/members` (owner-gated invite). Delivery reuses the existing `notify()` (durable in-app `freelancer_notifications` row + optional email webhook) for existing teammates, and a new `sendChatInviteEmail` (Resend, best-effort) for cold emails. Directing a message to a `@human` also notifies them (`chat_mention`). Global **NotificationBell** added to the web `TopBar` (reuses `/api/notifications`) — the first app-wide surface of the in-app inbox; chat notifications deep-link to `/ide/dashboard?chat=`.
- **`@agent` reply is a real tool-executing run.** `POST /api/brain/chats/:id/agent-reply` → `BrainService.agentReply`: resolves the agent's persona + ingested knowledge via the shared `resolveWorkforceModel`, then runs a **bounded server-side tool loop** (≤6 iters) over the curated non-destructive platform allowlist (`CLOUD_AGENT_PLATFORM_TOOLS` — projects/tasks/specs/OKRs/knowledge reads + safe writes, no deletes/control-plane), executed via `callBuiltinTool` with the **triggering user's role + token** so the agent can never exceed the human's own permissions. So an addressed teammate agent can actually DO things (create a follow-up task, update an OKR, read the board), not just chat. The final answer posts as an assistant turn **attributed to the agent** via a new `authoredBy` metadata key (mirrors `addressedTo`; no message-table migration). Wired into the shared `useBrainConversation.send()` (optional `persistence.requestAgentReply`) so all surfaces trigger it after a directed `@agent` turn; `BrainTimeline` renders the agent's avatar/name on its turns. (File-editing stays the BRAIN/host loop's job — tracked by the separate "Unify the agent LOOP" roadmap epic.)
- **Shared UI + both hosts.** `brain-embedded` (`AUTHORED_BY_META_KEY`/`parseMessageAuthor`, `requestAgentReply` adapter method, agent-reply trigger); `brain-ui` (humans in `useChatParticipants`, a **People** section in `ChatTicketsPanel` with email invite + lock toggle); web `BrainPanel`/`ChatTicketsPanel` wrapper + `builderforceApi` (`listChatMembers`/`inviteChatMember`/`removeChatMember`/`requestAgentReply`, `updateChat` visibility); VS Code webview adapters + lock toggle; native SESSIONS tree resolves human names inline (no raw user-ids). All new UI localized in `en/zh/es/fr/de`.
- **Cold-invite join flow.** Inviting a non-tenant email also creates a pending `tenant_invitations` row, so the existing tenant-invite auto-conversion adds them to `tenant_members` on signup; `syncPendingMemberships` then promotes their `chat_members` row to active on first access — one seamless join, no extra step.
- Versions: api `2026.7.25` · frontend `2026.7.25` · brain-embedded `2026.7.11` · brain-ui `2026.7.9` · VS Code VSIX `builderforce-ai-2026.7.33.vsix`. Verified: api type-clean on all changed files (pre-existing `TaskRepository`/`convertWorkItemType`/`interactionActivity` errors are unrelated + tsgo-preview flakiness), frontend `tsc` 0 errors, VS Code webview + host `tsc` clean, brain-embedded + brain-ui + webview rebuilt, VSIX packaged, migration + schema-drift checks pass.

## ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-05 — Chat↔ticket: every planning/project kind is linkable, referenceable & MCP-creatable

Followed the chat↔ticket auto-link work (open an item → the chat is tied to it) by making the FULL set of planning/project kinds first-class across **link + reference + create**. Kinds are now `portfolio | objective | initiative | roadmap | spec | epic | gap | task`.

- **New linkable ticket kinds.** Added `roadmap` (own `roadmap_items` table, status-based health — `shipped`=done), `gap` (a `task_type`, tasks-table leaf), and `spec`/PRD (own table, `complete`=done) to `ChatTicketService` (`TICKET_KINDS` + `resolveTicket` + `ticketHealthBatch`), the shared `@seanhogg/builderforce-brain-ui` (`TicketKind`/labels/`RUNNABLE_KINDS`; +gap runnable), the web `builderforceApi.TicketKind` + `ChatTicketsPanel` adapter (`loadTicketOptions` now fetches roadmap + specs + buckets gaps), the VS Code webview adapter, and all five `brain.tickets.kind.*` locale catalogs. `chat_ticket_links.ticketKind` is `varchar(12)` — **no migration**.
- **Auto-link on open for every page kind.** Roadmap-page rows carry a `roadmap` ticket and PRD-page rows a `spec` ticket through the `seed`+`ticket` intent (`ProjectListAction.ticket` in brain-ui → `projectPagePanel` → webview `linkOpenedTicket`); tree/board/360/backlog task/epic/gap link through `startTaskSession`.
- **Creatable via MCP.** Added `roadmap.list/get/create/update/delete` built-in MCP tools (direct insert + cache invalidation via the shared `trackerCacheKey`, moved to `infrastructure/cache/readThroughCache` so route + MCP writers share one key format), and added `gap` to the `tasks.create` `taskType` enum. `chats.link_ticket`/`chats.list_tickets` enums + descriptions updated for `roadmap`/`spec`/`gap`. Portfolio/objective/initiative/spec create tools already existed.
- Versions: api `2026.7.22` · frontend `2026.7.22` · brain-ui `2026.7.7` · VSIX `builderforce-ai-2026.7.31.vsix`. Verified: api type-clean on all changed files, frontend `tsgo` 0 errors, VS Code host+webview `tsc` clean, brain-ui + webview rebuilt.

---

## ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-05 — Workforce → Teams: card affordance, card/panel count consistency, full i18n

Fixed the two reported Teams-tab bugs and closed the localization gap the fix exposed.

- **Card affordance.** The team card was a bare `<button>` with no cue it opened the manage panel. Added a persistent pencil/"manage" glyph (`ManageIcon`, always visible so it reads on touch too, coral tint on hover), hover elevation (coral border + shadow + lift) on cards, a row-highlight + trailing action column in the List view, and an `aria-label` on both.
- **"1 member" vs "6 in panel".** The list read (`GET /api/teams`) is cached while the detail read (`GET /:id`) is uncached/authoritative, so a membership add could leave the card's count stale (cross-isolate L1). `loadDetail` now reconciles the matching card/row in the summary list from the authoritative detail, and `refreshAfterMutation` no longer refetches the whole list (which could clobber the reconciled count with a stale cached value). Backend: dropped the list read's L1 TTL to 5s (`teamRoutes.ts`) so cross-isolate staleness converges fast; KV stays the source of truth and is invalidated on every write.
- **Full localization.** `TeamsView.tsx` migrated off hardcoded English to `useTranslations` under a new `workforce.teams.*` namespace (42 keys, ICU plurals with rich `<b>` for the counts, `common.*` reused for cancel/delete); real zh/es/fr/de added to all five catalogs. Kind labels (Human / Cloud agent / Remote host) localized via dynamic `kind.*` keys.
- Verified: frontend `tsgo --noEmit` 0 errors, `eslint TeamsView.tsx` clean, all five catalogs parse.

---

## ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-05 — Kanban Templates folded into Projects tab + shared roles-CRUD hook

Consolidated the standalone `/kanban-templates` page into Projects as a **Templates** tab and removed the top-level menu item, then closed the roles-CRUD duplication the move exposed.

- **Consolidation.** Extracted the templates UI into `components/KanbanTemplatesContent.tsx` (a `*Content` component like `CeremoniesContent`), rendered by `app/projects/page.tsx` under `?tab=templates`; added the `templates` tab to the Projects group in `lib/navGroups.ts` and deleted the `kanbanTemplates` nav group. `/kanban-templates` now `redirect()`s to `/projects?tab=templates` (same pattern as `/pmo` + `/ceremonies`). Feature link in `lib/content.ts` repointed; `group.kanbanTemplates` removed and `tab.templates` added across all five i18n catalogs.
- **Shared roles-CRUD hook (`Roster/roles` gap).** `RolesView` (Workforce → Roles) and the templates Roles sub-tab both hand-rolled `listRoles`/`createRole`/`deleteRole` + the discipline list and could drift. New `lib/useRoles.ts` owns the list state, `reloadRoles`/`createRole`/`deleteRole` (optimistic), and the canonical `ROLE_DISCIPLINES` constant; both surfaces consume it. Deleted the duplicated `DISCIPLINES` array and inline CRUD.
- Verified: frontend `tsgo --noEmit` 0 errors; all five message catalogs parse.

---

## ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-05 — Bring-your-own frontier models (Anthropic + OpenAI + Google), modality-aware BYO billing

Enterprise tenants can now connect their OWN Anthropic, OpenAI, and/or Google accounts; connected providers drive the model choices and the tenant's own account serves the calls. Shipped end-to-end across the gateway, all three modalities, and billing. api `2026.7.19`, frontend `2026.7.19`, VS Code `2026.7.30`. Migration **0284**.

- **Modality-aware BYO metering (the load-bearing fix).** `llm_usage_log` gains `byo` + `surface` (mig 0284). The single ledger writer `usageLedger.recordUsageRow` forces `cost_usd_millicents = 0` for BYO rows (platform pays nothing), and the shared accountant `tokenUsage.ts` (`billableRow` = `notImageRow ∧ NOT (byo ∧ surface ∈ {on_prem,vsix})`) EXEMPTS own-machine BYO usage from the plan token allowance while still counting BYO **cloud** usage. Because `enforceTokenCaps`, `checkTenantTokenGate`, AND the consumption meter all share that one accountant, the rule holds everywhere at once: on-prem/VSIX BYO = free & uncapped; cloud BYO = charged (free tenants must upgrade for volume); non-BYO unchanged. Surface is threaded through every `logUsage`/`recordCloudUsage` site; the VSIX sends `X-Builderforce-Surface: vsix`, on-prem is derived from `agentHostId`, cloud from `recordCloudUsage`.
- **Multi-provider credential layer.** `tenantProviderKeyService` widened `SUPPORTED_PROVIDERS = ['anthropic','openai','google']` with `PROVIDER_VENDOR_MAP`, `resolveTenantVendorKeys` (one-query decrypt of BYO api-keys), and `resolveTenantLlmCredentials` (subscription token + vendor keys in one parallel round-trip). `LlmProxyService.vendorEnv()` overlays tenant keys onto the operator env per request and marks those vendors tenant-funded → `ProxyResult.byoFunded` (stamped in `finalize` via `isTenantFunded`).
- **Connected-providers drive model choice.** `/llm/v1/models` returns `byo:{providers,models}` + `canChooseModel`; `useLlmModels`/`ModelSelect` render a "Connected providers" model group and gate the picker on `canChooseModel` (paid **or** BYO). The free-plan model-choice gates (`pickCloudModel` `canChooseModel`, the `strict_pin_not_allowed` 402) now lift for a model whose vendor the tenant has connected — shared `byoVendorIdSet`/`providersFromCredentials`.
- **All three modalities.** VSIX = zero client change beyond the surface header (gateway resolves BYO). Cloud = both `cloudAgentEngine` proxy sites thread `tenantVendorKeys` + `byoVendors`. On-prem (Claude Agent SDK → `/v1/messages`): BYO-Anthropic passes through to `api.anthropic.com`; a non-Anthropic model rides the cascade branch which now overlays the tenant's OpenAI/Google key, stamped `byo`+`on_prem` (free).
- **Web UI (fully localized).** `ProviderKeysSettings` rewritten as a responsive 3-card grid via one shared DRY `ProviderConnectionCard` (Anthropic keeps subscription OAuth; OpenAI/Google are API-key). Full next-intl coverage across four namespaces with real translations in all 5 catalogs (`en/zh/es/fr/de`): `providerKeys` (the cards, incl. `t.rich` for `<code>`/`<b>`), `modelSelect` (picker group labels), `runAgentControl` (the whole run control — agent/model/repo pickers, PRO gate, run button, no-writable-repo warnings), and `apiKeys` (the entire `/settings/api-keys` page shell — heading, subtitle, create form, key list, table headers, revoke confirm). Theme-token colors + responsive layouts (light/dark, mobile-safe). No hardcoded user-facing English remains on any surface this feature touched.
- Verified: api + frontend + VS Code typecheck 0 errors; 140 affected api tests pass (llmRoutes, LlmProxyService, tokenUsage, tenantTokenAvailability, cloudTelemetry).

---

## ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-05 — Email verification (OTP) at signup — stop fake / unowned-email accounts

Fake accounts were signing up because password registration issued a live session instantly with **no proof the email was owned** (there was no `emailVerified` concept at all — the existing MFA is opt-in TOTP challenged only at *login*, and magic-link only logs in *existing* users). Added a 6-digit email-ownership gate on password signup. Shipped: api `2026.7.18`, frontend `2026.7.17`.

- **Schema + mig 0285** — `users.email_verified_at` + new `email_verification_codes` table (hashed 6-digit code, `expires_at`, `attempts`, `consumed_at`). Migration **backfills `email_verified_at = created_at` for every existing account** so no current user is ever locked out; the gate only traps NEW password signups. OAuth-created users are stamped verified on insert (the provider vouches).
- **Backend** — `application/auth/EmailVerificationService.ts` (issue/verify: single-use, 15-min TTL, 5-attempt cap, 60s resend cooldown, newest-code-wins; raw code never stored). `/web/register` now creates the account UNVERIFIED, emails a code, and returns `{ verificationRequired, email }` with **no session**. New `/web/register/verify` (exchanges the code for a session; `trustDevice` → 30-day session vs 24h) and `/web/register/resend` (cooldown-guarded, enumeration-safe). `/web/login` gates unverified accounts (403 + re-sends a code). `EmailService.sendVerificationCodeEmail` template added.
- **Frontend** — shared `components/account/EmailVerificationStep.tsx` (DRY: used by BOTH register and login flows) with code entry, "keep me signed in 30 days", resend, and localized error mapping off the server `reason` code. `lib/auth.ts` `login`/`register` now return a discriminated `AuthStepResult` (session **or** `needsVerification`); added `verifyEmailCode` + `resendVerificationCode`; `AuthContext` gained `verifyEmail`. New UI fully localized under `emailVerify.*` in all 5 catalogs.
- Verified: api `tsgo` + schema-drift + migration-sequence checks clean; frontend `tsgo` **and** `tsc --noEmit` clean; `auth.test.ts` updated (17 pass) covering the verification branch + `verifyEmailCode`/`resend`. Also resolves the prior ROADMAP gap "pre-existing type errors in `auth.test.ts`" — the `AuthStepResult` union is now narrowed in the tests. Open follow-ups (ROADMAP): full i18n of the surrounding register/login page copy; optional sweep of pre-existing fake accounts. End-to-end email delivery + the live DB path need the running stack (Resend + Neon) to exercise.

## ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-05 — Multi-party chat parity: recipient routing on the web Brain + true avatars in the sessions tree

Follow-up to the multi-party-chat ship below: brought the "address a message to a participant, not the BRAIN" paradigm to the **web** Brain (the user's "same paradigm across all modalities") and upgraded the SESSIONS-tree participant indicator from initials-text to real coloured avatars. Shipped: brain-embedded `2026.7.10`, brain-ui `2026.7.6`, VS Code `2026.7.29` (`builderforce-ai-2026.7.29.vsix`).

- **Routing logic is now shared (DRY).** Extracted `mentionRecipient`, `resolveRecipient`, and the `RecipientChoice` type into `brain-embedded/src/directedMessage.ts`, and the `useChatParticipants(adapter, chatId, refreshSignal)` hook into `brain-ui` — so both composers derive the recipient identically. The VS Code webview App was refactored to consume the shared versions (its local copies deleted). New `directedMessage.test.ts` (9 tests) locks the metadata round-trip + `@mention`/choice resolution.
- **Web Brain composer recipient picker** — `frontend/src/components/brain/BrainPanel.tsx`: a "To: <avatar> <name>" `<Select>` beside the persona picker (only once the chat has participants), the recipient-aware placeholder, and `handleSend` now passes `{ addressedTo }`. Participants are resolved from the chat's invited agents against the pool BrainPanel already loads — with a new module-level `loadAgentPoolCached()` (`lib/agentPool.ts`) that dedups the pool fan-out across the persona picker, the ticket adapter and the recipient picker (fixing a pre-existing 2× fetch). The web timeline shows the `→ recipient` badge for free (shared `BrainTimeline`). Fully localized (`brain.to`/`brainRecipient`/`recipientPickerTitle`/`messageParticipant` across all 5 catalogs).
- **True avatars in the SESSIONS tree** — `sessionsTree.ts` now renders each session row's participants as a composite `data:` SVG icon (up to two overlapping coloured initial discs; `avatarColor` kept in sync with brain-ui), with initials in the description and full names in the tooltip.
- Verified: frontend `tsc` 0 errors; brain-embedded 60 tests (+9 new) pass; host + webview typecheck clean; VSIX packaged. Remaining (ROADMAP ▸ Brain / chat): inviting humans (participant model + delivery + shared-chat access) and making `@agent` trigger that agent's reply.

## ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-05 — Multi-party chat: address messages to participants, not just the BRAIN (+ dropdown theme fix, session participant indicators)

Collaboration is the purpose of the VSIX chat, but every message ran the BRAIN — there was no way to invite a teammate into a chat and just talk to them, and the agent-invite dropdown rendered with default light colours in a dark editor. Shipped: brain-embedded `2026.7.9`, brain-ui `2026.7.5`, api `2026.7.16`, VS Code `2026.7.28` (`builderforce-ai-2026.7.28.vsix`).

- **Dropdown theme fix** — the shared `ChatTicketsPanel`'s native `<select>`s (invite-agent, run-agent, link pickers) used web-app-only CSS vars (`--bf-ct-*`/`--bg-base`) absent in the webview, so they fell through to `transparent`/`inherit` and Chromium drew them as light controls. Fix = a `V` token map whose fallback chains resolve in BOTH hosts (web `--bf-ct-*` → editor `--vscode-dropdown-*`/`--bf-*` → literal) + `colorScheme:'inherit'` (`packages/brain-ui/src/chatTickets/ChatTicketsPanel.tsx`).
- **Directed-message routing** — `brain-embedded/src/directedMessage.ts` (new): a `user` turn tagged `{addressedTo:{kind,ref,name}}` in metadata is a message FOR that participant, not a BRAIN directive. `useBrainConversation.send(text,{addressedTo})` persists it but skips `startRun`, and the trailing-user auto-reply effect skips directed turns — so the agent loop stays idle. `DirectedRecipient.kind` is `'agent'|'human'` (human-ready).
- **Composer recipient picker + `@mention`** — the VS Code composer gains a "To: <avatar> <name> ▾" selector (only once a chat has participants; solo chats unchanged, everything → BRAIN). Explicit pick or a leading `@name` routes the turn; placeholder switches to "Message {name}…". Participants come from the invited agents resolved against the (now adapter-cached, dedup'd) agent pool.
- **Timeline + avatars** — `brain-ui` `<Avatar>`/`<ParticipantBadge>` (deterministic-colour initials disc, theme-agnostic); the timeline renders a `→ Name` badge on directed user turns.
- **SESSIONS tree participant indicators** — `BrainService.listChats` folds `participants:[{ref,kind}]` via ONE guarded grouped `agent_assignments` query (no N+1, additive — a failure never breaks the list); `bfApi.listAgentPool` resolves refs→names (cached); the native tree appends `· 👥 BK MQ +N` initials to the row description + a full-name tooltip. Refreshes live on invite/remove (`ChatTicketsPanel.onChanged` now fires on invite/remove → `chats.changed` → `tree.refresh()`).
- Verified: brain-embedded 51 tests + api 1851 tests pass; brain-embedded/brain-ui/host/webview typecheck clean; VSIX packaged. Follow-ups (human invite + delivery, `@agent` reply-trigger, web/other-modality composer parity, true tree avatars) logged to ROADMAP ▸ Brain / chat.

## ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-05 — VSIX↔cloud tool-catalog unification finished (container parity + web-Brain manifest retired)

The two follow-ups from the durable-surface parity work below. Shipped: api `2026.7.16`, frontend `2026.7.15`.

- **Container surface reaches parity.** The long-lived Container runs its own image loop (`api/container/server.mjs`) and previously had no platform tools. Now: the Worker-controlled container `llm` op advertises `[...CONTAINER_AGENT_TOOLS, ...cloudAgentPlatformToolSchemas()]`; `server.mjs execTool` relays any `builtin_*` call back via a new `platform_tool` container-op; `handleContainerOp` runs it through the same subset-guarded `callBuiltinTool` (MANAGER role, project-defaulted) and records a tool event. The prompt guidance that makes the agent USE these tools was moved from `runCloudToolLoop` into the shared `prepareCloudRun` so ALL surfaces (Worker/DO durable + container) get it once (DRY) — no duplication.
- **Legacy web-Brain manifest retired.** `frontend/src/lib/brain/platformActions.ts` was a client-side manifest that re-declared ~210 data capabilities also in the server `builtinMcpService.CATALOG`. Verified every one of the 210 was covered by the catalog (0 uncovered), so the whole data layer was dead (already excluded at runtime by `excludeToolKeys`). Removed it — the file now holds ONLY the 3 client-only actions the server structurally can't do (`navigate_to`, `open_project`, `open_migration_panel` — browser navigation + a UI window event). `McpExtensionsBridge` (gateway `/llm/v1/mcp/tools`) is now the SINGLE source of the platform data tools, shared with the VS Code chat. `PlatformActionsBridge` simplified (no more catalog-exclude fetch / route-focus); `index.ts` exports + the test trimmed. Net: platform tools live in exactly TWO shared sources — `core-tools.ts` (dev tools) + `builtinMcpService.CATALOG` (platform tools) — reachable from every surface.
- Tests: api engine + builtin subset tests (27) green; frontend `platformActions.test.ts` rewritten to the client-only surface (13) green. tsgo clean on both packages.

---

## ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-05 — Cloud agent gets the curated platform toolset (VSIX↔cloud work-management parity)

The cloud coding agent could only edit repo files — it couldn't create a task, update an OKR, or read what's remaining, while the VS Code / web Brain had the full ~245-tool platform catalog. (Developer/file tools were already single-sourced via `packages/agent-tools/core-tools.ts` — no duplication there.) Shipped: api `2026.7.15`.

- **Curated, safe-by-default subset** — `CLOUD_AGENT_PLATFORM_TOOLS` in `api/src/application/llm/builtinMcpService.ts`: projects/tasks/specs/objectives(OKR)/key_results/initiatives/portfolios read+write, `work_items.convert_type`, `pmo.tree/rollup`, `project_facts`, `project_files`, `attachments`, `reviews.record`, `tickets.from_delta`, and **read-only** executions. Explicit allowlist EXCLUDES all admin/destructive surface (no deletes, no `executions.submit/cancel/post_message`, nothing under `api_keys`/`security`/`provider_keys`/`migrations`/`agent_hosts`/…) so an unattended agent can't reach it. New `cloudAgentPlatformToolSchemas()` (memoized `builtin_*` OpenAI schemas) + `resolveCloudAgentPlatformTool()` (subset-only reverse lookup — refuses off-list names even if the model hallucinates one).
- **Wired into the durable/Worker loop** — `cloudAgentEngine.ts runCloudToolLoop` advertises `[...CLOUD_AGENT_TOOLS, ...platformTools]` and dispatches `builtin_*` calls via `callBuiltinTool` in-process (tenant-scoped, `TenantRole.MANAGER`, project defaulted to the run's project so follow-up tasks land correctly). Governance policy gate + tool-event recording apply to platform tools too (they route through the same dispatch branch).
- **Made live in the prompt** — the cloud system prompt now instructs the agent to file a NEW task for any out-of-scope gap it finds (don't silently drop it), update OKR/objective progress its work advances, and base its "what remains" summary on real state (`builtin_tasks_list` + the tasks it created), not a guess.
- Tests: allowlist membership + admin/destructive exclusion + `builtin_*` schema shape + subset-only resolver (`builtinMcpService.test.ts`). tsgo clean; 90 tests pass across the affected files.
- Follow-up (ROADMAP): the long-lived **Container** surface runs its own image loop and doesn't yet advertise these; and the legacy web-Brain `frontend/src/lib/brain/platformActions.ts` manifest should be retired onto the one server catalog.

## ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-05 — Brain agentic turns floored onto a weak non-coder model (root cause of "claimed a write, no changes")

Complement to the same-day attachment/honesty fix below. That fix caught the *symptom* (phantom-save claim); this fixes the *root cause* — the model doing it. The VS Code Brain streams to `POST /llm/v1/chat/completions`, which auto-selected over the general `FREE_MODEL_POOL` and floored onto `GUARANTEED_BACKSTOP_MODEL` = `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite` — the model the coding path's own comment says "loops on search and ships no edits." The coders-only floor (`CODING_MODEL_POOL` / `CODING_BACKSTOP_MODELS` / `pickCloudModel`) existed **only** on the cloud coding-agent path; the Brain (and every gateway completion) bypassed it, because failover is error-gated, not capability-gated.

- **One shared routing path for all modalities** — new `proxyForCompletion(env, access, body, opts)` in `api/src/presentation/routes/llmRoutes.ts`. When the body carries `tools` (an agentic tool-loop turn — Brain, on-prem, any tool-calling SDK) it passes `{ codingOnly: true, backstopModels: CODING_BACKSTOP_MODELS }`, mirroring `cloudAgentEngine`. Agentic turns now walk free coders → paid coder backstop → funded Anthropic floor, never the lite non-coder. Plain (no-tools) chat keeps the plan-aware general pool.
- **Wired into BOTH** `/v1/chat/completions` and the `/v1/messages` our-models branch (user directive: "same path for all modalities, consolidate"), so the OpenAI-shape and Anthropic-shape (Claude Agent SDK) endpoints can no longer drift onto different model ladders. `/v1/messages` stays as a required protocol shim — it's the path `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` (the V2 runner) hard-codes; deleting it would kill the cloud+on-prem coding runtime.
- Tests: 2 new regression tests in `llmRoutes.test.ts` (tools → `codingOnly:true` + `CODING_BACKSTOP_MODELS`; no-tools → general pool). tsgo clean; 28 llmRoutes tests pass.

---

## ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-05 — Brain roadmap-reconciliation: duplicate items + phantom file "save"

Root-caused from a failed Brain run (attach a ROADMAP.md → "transition outstanding items to OKRs/Epics/Tasks and write the IDs back"): it created duplicate items and claimed it updated the attached file when it could not. Shipped: api `2026.7.13`, frontend `2026.7.13`, brain-embedded `2026.7.7`.

- **Idempotent creates (no more duplicates)** — `tasks.create` / `objectives.create` / `key_results.create` in the gateway builtin catalog (`api/src/application/llm/builtinMcpService.ts`) now dedup by normalized title in-scope (task→project, objective→workspace/segment, KR→objective) and return the existing record as `{ deduped: true, … }` instead of a second row — so a re-run yields the existing id for traceability. Mirrored in the frontend client-manifest fallback via a shared `dedupedCreate` helper (`frontend/src/lib/brain/platformActions.ts`), so the web Brain never duplicates whether it runs the server `builtin_*` tool or the client fallback.
- **Real attachment write-back (no more phantom saves)** — new `attachments.read` (paginated — fixes "file too large to read") and `attachments.write` (overwrites the R2 upload in place, tenant-scoped by key prefix, metadata-preserving) builtin tools. Uploads were previously served read-only by signature with no write path, so a "saved the file" claim was structurally impossible to honor.
- **Honesty guard** — the shared Brain system prompt (`frontend/src/lib/brain/platformPrompt.ts`) now instructs: edit an attachment via read→edit→`attachments.write`, and NEVER claim a save/update/write unless a write tool returned success this turn. Backed by a structural detector `detectUnbackedWriteClaim(events, messages)` in the shared triage module (`brain-embedded/src/brainTriage.ts`) that surfaces a `⚠ UNBACKED WRITE CLAIM` line in every triage capture when an assistant turn claims a file write with no successful write tool call.
- Tests: builtin dedup + attachment read/write/tenant-scope (`builtinMcpService.test.ts`), client-manifest dedup (`platformActions.test.ts`), unbacked-write-claim detector (`brainTriage.test.ts`).

## ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-05 — VS Code extension: 5 "real features" (assignable runtime, workforce/observability card, per-task diff, workforce embed, IDE Brain seed)

The larger VS Code roadmap items, built end-to-end. Shipped: api `2026.7.14`, frontend `2026.7.14`, builderforce-embedded `2026.6.30`, brain-embedded `2026.7.8`, extension VSIX `2026.7.27`.

- **VS Code as an assignable runtime (assigned-task delivery, tracked HITL).** The roadmap framed this as "add `'vscode'` to `agent_type`", but that enum is the LLM-provider axis (`claude|openai|ollama|http`) — the *assignee* axis is host/cloud/**human**. Assigning to a VS Code runtime is correctly modeled as assign-to-human + deliver-to-editor (a bare enum value would be a dead seam). Built the missing delivery loop: `GET /api/vscode/tasks` (open tasks assigned to the signed-in user, tenant-scoped via the project join, bounded 50, uncached like its `/tenants` sibling since it must reflect a just-assigned task) + `bfApi.listAssignedTasks` + an extension poll folded into the existing 5-min heartbeat (`pollAssignedTasks`) that notifies on newly-assigned work (first poll seeds silently so it doesn't announce the backlog) and "Show my tasks" flips the Projects & Tasks tree to its assigned-to-me filter. Status flows back through the existing `PATCH /api/tasks/:id`. Tests: `vscodeRoutes.test.ts` (+2). l10n in all 5 VS Code bundles.
- **Workforce + Observability VS Code presence.** New `vscodeConnections.list()` client + `isVscodeConnectionOnline()` (single liveness source: active + heartbeat < 11 min). Added a `'vscode'` kind to the shared `AgentTypePill`; `WorkforceAgents` now renders VS Code editors as read-only presence cards + table rows (mirroring the remote-host block); `ObservabilityContent` lists them as directory/presence chips (no timeline — VS Code emits no tool-audit telemetry). No new backend route (reused `GET /api/vscode/connections`). New strings under the `workforce.vscode` i18n namespace in all 5 catalogs.
- **First-class per-task diff panel.** Extracted the agent panel's Changes sub-tab into a shared `TaskChangesPanel` (owns the file-change list + Monaco diff detail; self-fetches `runtimeApi.taskFileChanges` when no execution-scoped list is passed). `AgentExecutionPanel` now delegates to it (DRY — removed its local `ChangeRow`/`CHANGE_COLOR`/`openChange`), and a new first-class **Changes** tab in the task drawer (`TaskMgmtContent`) renders it. New `taskChanges` i18n namespace + `taskMgmt.tabChanges` in all 5 catalogs.
- **`workforce` embed view.** Registered in `EMBED_VIEWS` (`builderforce-embedded`, pillar `agile`) + a `case 'workforce'` in `embed/[view]/page.tsx` rendering the existing `WorkforceAgents` grid (auth via the frame session; root layout provides `AuthProvider`). Rebuilt the package dist.
- **Web Project 360 "Improve with Brain" → one-click seed.** `BrainPanel` already had `initialPrompt` + auto-send; threaded a `?prompt=` param from `/ide/[id]` → `IDE` → `IDENew` into the docked `BrainPanel` and (for non-docked modalities) published it through `BrainContext` (new `initialPrompt` field in `brain-embedded`, consumed by `FloatingBrain`). `ProjectHealthPanel` now deep-links the `brain` action's ready-made seed text as `/ide/:id?prompt=`. Tests: FloatingBrain + brain-embedded suites green.

---

## ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-05 — VS Code extension auth/token residuals

Confirmation pass over the "VS Code extension" roadmap section. Fixed the genuinely-broken items; confirmed the rest already resolved. Shipped: api `2026.7.13`, extension VSIX `2026.7.26`.

- **`/api/auth/agentHost-token` signed a jti it never persisted** (latent auth bug). A machine token's `authTokens.userId` FK cannot resolve to a real user, so the token would be rejected by `authMiddleware`'s jti-revocation check. Fixed by exempting `agentHost:` subjects from that check (`api/src/presentation/middleware/authMiddleware.ts`), mirroring the existing terms-check exemption — machine tokens are short-lived and API-key-gated by design.
- **Key-revoke endpoint implemented** — `POST /api/auth/keys/revoke` (`authRoutes.ts`) + `revokeTenantApiKeyByRawKey()` (`application/llm/tenantApiKeyService.ts`): self-service revoke of a `bfk_*` editor key by presenting the raw key (possession = authorization, no JWT), idempotent, invalidates the auth cache. The VS Code extension now calls it on sign-out (`clients/vscode/src/auth.ts removeSession`) so the server-side key dies with the local session instead of being orphaned. Guard test added.
- **Confirmed already-resolved** (no code change needed): 429 free-plan-cap upsell in the extension (`extension.ts:630-647`, "Upgrade to Pro" → /pricing); superadmin free-plan token-cap bypass (`PlanLimits.ts:199-201`, returns structured 429/402 not 500); VS Code webview l10n bundles fully translated for de/es/fr/zh (`clients/vscode/l10n/`); the "OpenAgentHost" vs "openclaw" acknowledgements copy drift is no longer present anywhere in `clients/vscode`.
- **Confirmed still-open** (left in roadmap): `agent_type` has no `'vscode'` value + no task-poll/dispatch path (assigning tasks to a VS Code runtime is a full feature, not a residual); no dedicated workforce/observability card enumerating `vscode_connections`; no per-task diff panel; no `workforce` embed view; `/ide/:id?prompt=` one-click Brain seed.

## Resolved — by theme

### 🧠 Evermind / SSM

- **Frontier-LLM TEACHER distillation** (2026-07-03, api+frontend 2026.7.7) — pin any frontier model (Opus/Mistral/GLM) as a `teacher_model` (mig 0277) whose exemplar answers train a project's Evermind; coordinator DO distils in its alarm, cost-gated once/alarm via `getTenantTokenAvailability`, task-prompt distillation across all modalities (cloud/on-prem/VS Code), best-effort fallback to raw-text. `evermindTeacher.ts` + 13 tests.
- **Project Evermind — unified learning + default provisioning** (2026-07-03) — every project gets a default `EvermindLM`+BPE base on creation; all 3 modalities post text to ONE coordinator door (`…/evermind/learn-text`) that fits in its DO alarm (`MAX_FITS_PER_ALARM`, env-tunable) → FedAvg merge → R2; inference opt-in server-gated; editable in the LLM IDE; panel on all 4 modalities.
- **Facts tier — shared per-project write-through store** (2026-07-03) — `project_facts` (mig 0276) + `projectFacts.ts` (write-through by `(tenant,project,key)`, read-through cached) replaces VS Code local-disk `cognition.json`; backs cloud `memory_recall/remember`, on-prem knowledge-loop mirror, and web/VS-Code MCP tools.
- **Concurrent-learning coordinator — read-replica + single-writer** (2026-06-30) — per-project Evermind coordinator DO (weight-delta, pull-on-run-boundary); LIVE opt-in `inference_enabled` across all 3 surfaces + `ProjectEvermindPanel`.
- **Generative LM shipped** (`EvermindLM` in memory-engine `src/lm/`) — token embedding + depthwise causal conv mixer + shared-expert MoE FFN + tied head; CPU forward+backward (finite-diff checked), `generate()`, fp16/f32 checkpoint, trainer; overfit→generate + publish→buy→run tests pass. Closes the "not yet an LM" gap.
- **Shared-expert MoE generator core** — `SharedExpertMoE` + `MoETrainer` (AdamW + load-balance aux gradient) + `EvermindModelPackage` (portable `.evermind` artifact, FNV-1a integrity, model card); 15 tests.
- **Coding-skill foundation** (2026-06-30) — Phase 1 shipped; Phase 2 importer BUILT (v2026.6.36): `safetensorsToTensors`/`inferArchFromTensors`/`importEvermind` round-trips own exports, warm-starts a foreign checkpoint via a rename map, wired as the `import-model` workflow step.
- **Held-out coding benchmark** (2026-07-04, memory 2026.7.0) — `code-benchmark` workflow step scores strict pass@1 over unseen tasks via `runJsCases`, optional `minPass1` gate; wired into Teach-Code; 3 tests.
- **Benchmarking capability** (RESOLVED 2026-06-29, v2026.6.35) — engine republished exporting canonical `trainAndBenchmark`; frontend delegates (local duplicate deleted); server-side `benchmarkEvermind()` scores the user's actual trained `.evermind` via its own tokenizer; `POST /api/studio/models/:slug/benchmark` + BenchmarkPanel "Score a trained model" mode.
- **Model export / HF publishing** — IDE export wired 2026-06-30; ONNX/GGUF/safetensors emit; remaining items external/credential-blocked (transformers.js `pipeline()`, llama.cpp GGUF exec, live HF push).
- **Train→serve loop** (RESOLVED 2026-06-29) — Evermind is a generation backend in the gateway (`vendors/evermind.ts` runs a tenant's published `.evermind` on-CPU in the Worker); trained-SSM tenant base made live (`resolveTenantModel` falls back to `evermind/${trainedModelRef}`).
- **Learned-routing write-back for non-cloud runs** (2026-07-04, api 2026.7.11) — `POST /llm/v1/run-outcome` + `recordClientRunOutcome` + mig 0283 (`source`/`client_run_id`/nullable `execution_id`) fold IDE/on-prem/SDK run outcomes into the same routing table cloud runs teach.
- **Architecture review EVM-1..8** (RESOLVED 2026-06-28, v2026.6.34) + follow-ups EVM-1b/6b.
- **"Brain dies after several executions"** (2026-07-04) — root-caused to context exhaustion (primary) + `learn()` weight drift; fixed both: self-diagnosing copy button (`computeBrainDiagnostics` verdict, shared web+VS Code), 6KB tool-result cap + 24K-token window + compact list projections; Evermind stability rails (true WSLA freeze, `A_log` clamp, overflow-safe softplus, non-finite-step drop + trust region, rollback-on-regression).
- **Stale register entries retired** (2026-07-04): Project Evermind panel already on all 4 modalities; limbic `embedEvent` already uses the SSM hippocampus embedding; memory-package test suite (TS6059 → 0 tests) fixed via `isolatedModules:true` (22 tests green).
- **Seven-layer stack e2e (headless)** — `seven-layers.test.ts` exercises all 7 blog layers (L1/L3/L4/L7 real components).

### ⚙️ Agent runtime & engine consolidation

- **V1 RETIRED** (2026-06-13) — `builderforce-v2` is the consolidated default on every surface via one `DEFAULT_ENGINE_ID`; `runV1Engine` deleted, creation restricted to v2, mig 0120 back-fills legacy rows. (Cloud V1 dispatch branch + `builderforce-local` fate = tail items in ROADMAP.)
- **pi cutover — 3 of 4 `@mariozechner/pi-*` deps removed** (2026-06-13) — pi-agent-core/pi-coding-agent/pi-ai all deleted; native loop/tools/model-client/completion/OAuth+Codex; agent-runtime is pi-free + tsgo 0 + ~80 tests. 100 files/dirs renamed off `pi-*` names. Only pi-tui remains (→ ink behind the built `@builderforce/tui` `TuiRenderer` seam; migration is the ROADMAP tail).
- **Unified engine seam** — on-prem implements the shared `AgentEngine`; `resolveEngineById` shared; converged file tools behind `tools.fs.convergedFileTools`; `ask_human` on on-prem Node registry; `PolicyGate` `evaluatePolicyGate` hard-enforced at every engine's tool seam (cloud/on-prem/IDE), gates persist across DO ticks.
- **Shared tool catalogue** — 12 cross-runtime core + 21 Node-native tools under `@builderforce/agent-tools`; media tools port via the `ToolResult.content` block extension; `find-a-file-by-name` glob added to `list_files` across all 4 engines (2026-07-04, VSIX 2026.7.22).
- **`loadJsonFile` sync→async drift** — propagated `await` through the entire auth/credential/model subsystem; `tsc` green; github-copilot-token cache bug fixed.
- **SSM hippocampus loop** (DONE 2026-06-18) — agent-runtime loads `@seanhogg/builderforce-memory` (optionalDep), recall injected into prompts, KnowledgeLoop remembers per run; active cross-run `memory_recall/remember` tools for Node agents; server-side semantic cache wired into the cortex call; Worker/DO active memory (Postgres `agent_memory`, mig 0200); web `SemanticCache` L1.
- **frontend consumes engine via `@seanhogg/builderforce-memory-engine` npm** (DONE 2026-06-18), not the git URL.
- **TypeScript 6.0 + tsgo** (2026-06-27) — all ~20 packages on `typescript ^6.0.3` + `@typescript/native-preview`; TS6 breakages fixed (`ignoreDeprecations`, explicit `types`, `*.css` decl).
- **DRY / dead-code audit** (2026-07-04) — closed the deferred tail across api caching/perf (N+1 batching), api DRY utils (money/slugify/json/clamp/tokens/host-auth/R2-key single-sourced + permission-drift test), llm vendors (shared transport/probe/SSE parser, `slice(5)` fix), agent-runtime, agent-tools, VS Code (shared webview panels + `vscodeBridge` leak fix), frontend dead-code + i18n.

### ☁️ Cloud agent execution & PR loop

- **Always-on autonomous cloud execution** (global cron) + token gate + out-of-tokens upgrade email (2026-07-01).
- **Cloud V2 real Cloudflare Container + durable `CloudRunnerDO`** built (deploy verification remains in ROADMAP); Fly.io orphan deleted (Cloudflare-only).
- **Cloud git tools** — get-latest/undo/redo/status/diff/history added to the shared registry (shell-gated); full clone (dropped `--depth 1`); system prompt calls `git_sync_latest` first.
- **Multi-provider PR/repo loop** — GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket Cloud create/merge/detail + read/write/PR (live-provider validation remains).
- **Context compaction + context-aware model selection** — 413 → cascade to bigger-window model; `compactMessages.ts` summarizes the bulky middle before each paid call; both cloud loops persist compacted state.
- **Cloud HITL `ask_human`** (mig 0120) for durable/Worker surfaces; `paused` state + Slack/email + `PATCH /approvals/:id` resume.
- **Anti-stub / honesty gates** — `scanForPlaceholders` blocks a `finish` with stubs; `run_checks` real static validator (`verifyWrittenFiles`); `assertsUnrunVerification` blocks claiming an unrun check passed; "⚠ Not verified in-agent" annotation.
- **Post-merge build validation + auto-fix** — `merge_sha` correlation → failed-jobs fetch → capped auto-fix dispatch; opt-in merge-only-on-green gate.
- **Model-selection observability** — run-start `model.select` + `coding_model_degraded` events spell out cause + consequence.
- **Board execution-approval override** (board setting, 2026-06-30); autonomous lane chaining fires the next lane's agent on completion (2026-06-14); swimlane autonomous-agent trigger + ownership-clobber fix (2026-06-29).
- **Cost attribution** — ticket→project→tenant on `llm_usage_log` (migs 0103/0104); ticket spend on the execution panel + By-Project card; gateway tool-call portability (execution #91 triage, 2026-06-30).

### 🔀 LLM gateway, routing & cost

- **Anthropic cost-drain root-caused + fixed** (2026-06-15) — `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` was unbound (killing free-neuron routing); added + live CF coders; capacity-limit 4xx → retryable failover; `CODING_FREE_ATTEMPT_BUDGET` walks the whole free coding pool first; 60-min vendor cooldown on a capacity strike.
- **Paid-overflow cap** (mig 0130) — `tenants.paid_overflow_daily_cap` + `llm_usage_log.paid_overflow`; `isPaidOverflowExhausted` gate closes the funded path per-tenant while the primary pool keeps serving; superadmin cap editor; image-gen overflow classified + capped (2026-06-21).
- **Consumption meter framework** (`/api/consumption` multi-meter: `ai_tokens` + `ingestion`) — `enforceTokenCaps` (daily + monthly, cache-discounted, shared resolver so displayed==enforced); ingestion ledger (mig 0218, repo-import metered → 402); image credits separated from chat budget (mig 0131).
- **Prompt caching ON for every call** — `applyPromptCaching` in the shared body builder + direct-Anthropic floor; `_builderforce.cacheTtl:'1h'` honored gateway-side + on-prem (OpenRouter-Anthropic long TTL).
- **Cloudflare leads every paid pool** (free-neuron-first); CF moved to the OpenAI-compatible endpoint + one shared `buildOpenAIChatBody`.
- **Learned model routing (PRD 13)** — action-type classifier (mig 0197) → outcome scorer (0198) → `routing:<scope>` KV reorders `pickCloudModel`; kill switch.
